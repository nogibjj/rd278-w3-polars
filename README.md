# Descriptive Statistics 

## Goals:
The template created in week one was updatedfor this assignment, particularly pandas was added to have descriptive statistics.

## Functions implemented

Data is loaded using **panda.read_csv**, and the function **dataframe.describe()** is used in module **source_code.py** to return the mean, min, percentiles and max.

## Test:
Besides linting and formating, the code had two test:
1. Checks if the file path is a csv file
2. Checks if the output is a DataFrame

# A Scatter plot

Just for the sake of ilustration, a plot was added to see the relationship between the instrumentalness and energy percentages of every song.
